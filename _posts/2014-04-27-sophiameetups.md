**Meetup #2-3:** 

Triangle Open Data Day: https://plus.google.com/u/0/114432798864961395991/posts/7pXB4VzEU5G 

My experiences going to programming meet-ups have left me with a couple key observations. Before starting this 
class, some of the programmers I had met often seemed like a relatively solitary lot. Therefore, I have been interested 
and impressed by the number of groups that meet on a semi-regular basis in the programming community. In many 
ways, this community spirit is not too surprising after learning the focus on collaboration in programming. 
Learning the Github workflow in class exemplifies the programming mentality that collaboration is an ideal 
method for writing robust code.

At the Triangle Open Data Day session on Node.js, I reflected upon the culture in the room where programmers 
were openly discussing and sharing ideas. I believe this atmosphere is something unique in the programming 
community and is an admirable aspect of programming culture. There seems to be a prevalent vibe that knowledge 
shared in a collaborative fashion is the best way to learn and create. This also connects with the open-source 
idea of meritocracy, which was discussed at the Triangle Open Data Day by Jason Baker. Open-source and 
collaborative workflows harness the power of the crowd and facilitate the creation of the "best" code. 
The Girl Develop It! Coffee and Code meetup also had the vibe that just creating a space to openly discuss code is an intrinsic aspect 
of the programming community.

One other key take-away I gained from these meet-ups is the programming ideology that coding is often done 
with an eye on serving the greater good. I mention this in my write-up when discussing the idea of “Coding 
for America.” There seems to be an underlying belief in the value of serving some larger community need. My 
view could be partially skewed, since one of the key events I attended was specifically focused on open data 
and brought together people with a similar worldview that open access is in many ways a social good. However, 
I think this is also apparent through the open-source focus of many programming projects. While the importance 
of open-source is also tied to the culture of collaboration, I think it expands beyond the functional aspect of 
reusing code and incorporates an over-all perspective that code should be a community resource and not a 
proprietary product. This to me speaks of the social value created by seeing code as something to share, 
not something to own.

My last key observation relates to the role of gender in the programming community. I think in some ways the 
programming community is reinventing itself to break down some preconceived notions that programming is a 
male-dominated field. Groups like Girl Develop It! and events like Pearl Hacks show a focus on gender-specific 
events that communicate the growing number of females involved in the programming community. I think creating 
these kinds of support networks is important because it allows females a space to not only discuss code but 
potentially to discuss any specific challenges they may face being a female working in a technology-focused 
field. I liked the atmosphere at the Girl Develop It! meetup and am interested in taking some Girl Develop 
It! courses to continue learning more programming languages. In the end, I think programming culture is 
epitomized by its focus on collaboration and aiding the larger community, which in my opinion is worthwhile 
and inspiring.
